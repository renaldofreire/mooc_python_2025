## 🚀 About The Project

This repository documents my learning journey through the acclaimed **Python Programming MOOC 2025**, offered by the University of Helsinki. Its purpose is to systematically record my solutions to all exercises and challenges, applying everything from fundamental Python concepts to more advanced topics.

More than just a code backup, this project serves as a technical log of my progress, showcasing my problem-solving skills, coding style, and commitment to mastering the Python language.

## 🏁 Next Steps

My Python learning journey is just beginning. My future goals are:

- [ ] Implement unit tests with `pytest` for the more complex projects.
- [ ] Refactor the exercises from the earlier parts of the course using the OOP concepts and best practices I've learned since.
- [ ] Develop a small REST API using **Flask** or **FastAPI** to apply my Python knowledge in a back-end development context.
